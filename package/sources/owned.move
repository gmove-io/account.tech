/// This module allows multisig members to access objects owned by the multisig in a secure way.
/// The objects can be taken only via an Withdraw action.
/// This action can't be proposed directly since it wouldn't make sense to withdraw an object without using it.
/// Objects can be borrowed using an action wrapping the Withdraw action.
/// Caution: borrowed Coins can be emptied, only withdraw the amount you need
